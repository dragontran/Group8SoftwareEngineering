# Iterator
The Iterator design pattern is a behavioural pattern. It is used to manage algorithms, relationships, and responsibilites between objects. It provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object without exposing its underlying representation. 

An example of when it would be used is when one needs to access elements in a set without access to the entire representation. It can serve as a uniform traversal interface allowing for multiple traversals across elements.
