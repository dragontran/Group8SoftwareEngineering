# Factory
The Factory design pattern is a creational pattern. It is used to construct objects such that they can be decoupled from the implementing system.  

An example of when it would be used is when the client doesn't know what concrete classes it will be required to create at runtime, but wants a class that will do the job. It is often used in logging frameworks.
